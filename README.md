# Where's Paldo the Pouty Pup
Where's Paldo The Pouty Puppy? - A JavaScript matching game, where the player has to boop the extra pouty pup on the left. 

The left and right sides are identical, except for one thing: the left side has one extra pouty pup.
The user needs to click on that pup. If anything except the correct pup is clicked, a message is displayed saying that the game is over and
the amount of successfully booped pups is shown and a restart button is shown.
If the correct extra pup is clicked, all the currently displayed pups are removed and a new set of pups is shown at random positions.

Each time a new set of pups is shown there will be more faces than before, on both the left and the right sides.
There will always be one more pup shown on the left than on the right. The other pups on the right and left will be identical in position to each other.
